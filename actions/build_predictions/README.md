# Mapping Gene predictions onto Proteins

Having cleaned up the data from `TargetP` we now have a file called `mitochondrial_transfer_peptides.txt` that lists the names of every Genes that is predicted as being a "mitochondrial transfer peptide".

Our goal now is to map this information onto Proteins.
