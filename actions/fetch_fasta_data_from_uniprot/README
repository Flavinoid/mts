'data/in/protein_ids_samples.csv' is a small selection of the 'data/in/protein_ids.csv' file.

this is used for testing (using the main file takes a while and generates a 5mb file)

if you `./run --dev` it will use the smaller file!

a directory /out/fasta will be created that contains FASTA files suitable for uploading to ?
