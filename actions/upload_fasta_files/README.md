# Uploading to TargetP

Unfortunately this is currently a manual step.

Using either [http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) or the mirror
[https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?TargetP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?TargetP)

you can upload the files in `/fetch_fasta_data_from_uniprot/out/fasta` one by one. The server should take about 30 seconds or so before returning a result.

or using the mirror:

you can then download the JSON. To see the results of when it was last run (13/6/2020) have a look in [/data/out/json](./data/out/json)
