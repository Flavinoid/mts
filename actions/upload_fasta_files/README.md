# Uploading to TargetP

Unfortunately the first half of this action is currently a manual step.

Using [http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP-1.1/index.php](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP-1.1/index.php)

![Step 2](./howto/step2.png?raw=true)

These results should be added to the file [/data/out/predictions.txt](./data/out/predictions.txt).
